# [Learn React (Scrimba)](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e) - Bob Ziroll

This repository contains a collection of projects I built while learning React with Vite and Tailwind CSS.

Projects include:

- 💡 **[ReactFacts project](https://rc-reactfacts.netlify.app/)**: static webpage developed to preliminarily "think like a react developer" — imperative vs. declarative, custom components, common Tailwind CSS utility classes<br>
- ✈️ **[Travel Journal](https://rc-traveljournal.netlify.app/)**: static webpage that leverages props and reusable components to showcase past trips
- 🤖 **[Chef Claude](https://rc-chefclaude.netlify.app/)**: web application powered by [OpenAI's gpt-oss-120b](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-120b) that recommends recipes based on a list of available ingredients inputted by the user — driven by conditional rendering, states, refs, and secure api integration through netlify deployment
- 😂 **[Meme Generator](https://rc-memegenerator.netlify.app/)**: dynamic webpage built upon [Imgflip API](https://imgflip.com/api) to generate and customize memes
- 🔟 **[Tenzies](https://rc-tenzies.netlify.app/)**: minigame where players win by holding 10 dice of the same value — incorporates side effects, refs, and aria labels to address accessibility concerns
