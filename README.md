# [Learn React (Scrimba)](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e) - Bob Ziroll

This repository contains a collection of projects I built while learning React with Vite and Tailwind CSS.

Projects include:

- 💡 **ReactFacts project:** static webpage developed to preliminarily "think like a react developer" — imperative vs. declarative, custom components, common Tailwind CSS utility classes<br>
- ✈️ **Travel Journal:** static webpage that leverages props and reusable components to showcase past trips
- 🤖 **[Chef Claude:](https://nataliewxngg-chef-claude.netlify.app/)** web application powered by [OpenAI's gpt-oss-120b](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-120b) that recommends recipes based on a list of available ingredients inputted by the user — driven by conditional rendering, states, refs, and secure api integration through netlify deployment
- 😂 **Meme Generator:** dynamic webpage built upon [Imgflip API](https://imgflip.com/api) to generate and customize memes
